## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> A personâ€™s number of imaginary friends are always 25% (or 1/4) of their total friends.
> Write a function, numImaginaryFriends(), that takes in the total number of friends a person has and returns the number of imaginary friends they have.
> Since friends can only come in whole numbers, be sure to round your result up to the nearest whole number before returning it.
> The JavaScript Math.ceil() function will come in handy. Check out the documentation here to figure out how it works.
