## General information

> The Full-Stack Software Engineer Program allows to learn how to build web applications from start to finish. This path will start with the front-end, move to the back-end, then connect the two.
  
In this repository, I have only submitted the main projects that I worked on as part of my learning journey. These are personal projects to be done on one's computer, sometimes guided, sometimes with a correction but not always.

The other practical works and exercises proposed during the lessons are not mentioned. Most of the time they are simple application exercises.
