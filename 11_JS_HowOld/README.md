## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. 
> 
Handle three different cases:

- If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format: 'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
- If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'
- If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
