## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Though an objectâ€™s mass remains consistent throughout the universe, weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object. Since different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh different amounts on each of those planets! Cool, huh?

Write a function, calculateWeight(). It should:
* have two parameters: earthWeight and planet
* expect earthWeight to be a number
* expect planet to be a string
* return a number representing what that Earth-weight would equate to on the planet passed in.

Handle the following cases:

- **'Mercury'** weight = earthWeight * 0.378
- **'Venus'** weight = earthWeight * 0.907
- **'Mars'** weight = earthWeight * 0.377
- **'Jupiter'** weight = earthWeight * 2.36
- **'Saturn'** weight = earthWeight * 0.916
- For all other inputs, return **'Invalid Planet Entry**. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'
