## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Congratulations, you’ve become head librarian at your local Books-‘N-Stuff, which is in dire need of your help. They’re still using index cards to organize their content! Yikes.
> 
> But no matter, you know some JavaScript, so let’s get to work modernizing your new digs.
> 
> Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named  `Media`  with three subclasses:  `Book`,  `Movie`, and  `CD`. These three subclasses have the following properties and methods:
> 
> #### Book
> 
> -   **Properties**:  `author`  (string),  `title`  (string),  `pages`  (number),  `isCheckedOut`  (boolean, initially  `false`), and  `ratings`  (array, initially empty).
> -   **Getters**: all properties have a getter
> -   **Methods**:  `.getAverageRating()`,  `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and  `.addRating()`
> 
> #### Movie
> 
> -   **Properties**:  `director`  (string),  `title`  (string),  `runTime`  (number),  `isCheckedOut`  (boolean, initially  `false`), and  `ratings`  (array, initially empty)
> -   **Getters**: all properties have a getter
> -   **Methods**:  `.getAverageRating()`,  `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and  `.addRating()`
> 
> #### CD
> 
> -   **Properties**:  `artist`  (string),  `title`  (string),  `isCheckedOut`  (boolean, initially  `false`), and  `ratings`  (array, initially empty),  `songs`  (array of strings)
> -   **Getters**: all properties have a getter
> -   **Methods**:  `.getAverageRating()`,  `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and  `.addRating()`
> 
> If you’re looking for a challenge, try to create the four classes without using the steps below.
