## General information

Codecademy instructions :
> Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.
>
> The possible outcomes are:
>
>  - Rock destroys scissors.
>  - Scissors cut paper.
>  - Paper covers rock.
>  - If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw. 
>  
> Our code will break the game into four parts:
>
>  1. Get the user’s choice.
>  2. Get the computer’s choice.
>  3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
>  4. Start the program and display the results.
